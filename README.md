# The Twelve-Factor Agentic SDLC

This is a methodology for building software using AI coding agents as integral participants throughout the software development lifecycle. The twelve-factor agentic SDLC is a framework that optimizes the development process for modern AI-assisted software development, emphasizing maintainability, scalability, and effective human-AI collaboration.

## The Twelve Factors

I. [Strategic Mindset](/content/strategic-mindset.md)  
Developer as Orchestrator, AI as Intern

II. [Context Scaffolding](/content/context-scaffolding.md)  
Treat agent context as a first-class development dependency

III. [Mission Definition](/content/mission-definition.md)  
Every agent interaction begins with a formal mission brief

IV. [Structured Planning](/content/structured-planning.md)  
Decompose complex tasks through agent-generated, human-approved plans

V. [Execution Loops](/content/execution-loops.md)  
Choose between synchronous and asynchronous workflows based on task nature

VI. [The Great Filter](/content/great-filter.md)  
Developer as the Ultimate Arbiter of Quality

VII. [Quality Gates](/content/quality-gates.md)  
Implement workflow-appropriate review processes

VIII. [AI-Augmented Testing](/content/ai-augmented-testing.md)  
Risk-based testing strategy

IX. [Process Documentation](/content/process-documentation.md)  
Maintain clear records of development workflows

X. [Workflow Strategy](/content/workflow-strategy.md)  
Choose appropriate tools and platforms for development

XI. [Behavioral Consistency](/content/behavioral-consistency.md)  
Manage agent directives and prompts as versioned code

XII. [Team Capability](/content/team-capability.md)  
Develop organizational competencies in agentic workflows
