# IV. Structured Planning: Task Decomposition and Execution Strategy

## Statement

Decompose complex tasks through agent-generated, human-approved plans with clear sync/async boundaries.

## Explanation

The Structured Planning factor establishes that complex development tasks must be broken down into manageable steps through a formal planning process. The AI coding agent generates a detailed execution plan based on the Mission Brief, which the human developer reviews, modifies, and approves.

## Key Components

### Plan Generation

#### AI-Generated Plan Elements
- Task breakdown
- Dependency mapping
- Resource requirements
- Timeline estimates
- Risk assessments
- Success metrics

#### Human Review Criteria
- Technical feasibility
- Resource availability
- Risk evaluation
- Priority alignment
- Quality standards
- Team capabilities

### Workflow Classification

#### Synchronous Tasks
- Complex design decisions
- Critical code reviews
- Architecture discussions
- Real-time debugging
- Performance optimization

#### Asynchronous Tasks
- Routine code generation
- Documentation updates
- Test creation
- Code refactoring
- Static analysis

### Plan Structure

#### High-Level Overview
- Project goals
- Major milestones
- Critical paths
- Key dependencies
- Resource allocation

#### Detailed Breakdown
- Step-by-step tasks
- Task classifications
- Execution order
- Quality gates
- Review points

## Best Practices

1. **Task Analysis**
   - Identify core components
   - Map dependencies
   - Assess complexity
   - Determine sync/async boundaries

2. **Plan Review**
   - Validate assumptions
   - Check resource availability
   - Verify timeline feasibility
   - Confirm quality gates
   - Assess risk mitigation

3. **Plan Execution**
   - Track progress
   - Monitor dependencies
   - Adjust as needed
   - Document changes
   - Validate outcomes

## Plan Template

```markdown
# Execution Plan: [Project Name]

## Overview
[High-level description of the work to be done]

## Goals
- [Goal 1]
- [Goal 2]
- [...]

## Task Breakdown

### Phase 1: [Name]
- [ ] Task 1 [SYNC/ASYNC]
  - Dependencies:
  - Success Criteria:
  - Quality Gates:
- [ ] Task 2 [SYNC/ASYNC]
  - Dependencies:
  - Success Criteria:
  - Quality Gates:

[Additional phases as needed]

## Timeline
- Start Date:
- Key Milestones:
- End Date:

## Resources
- Required Tools:
- Team Members:
- External Dependencies:

## Risk Management
- Identified Risks:
- Mitigation Strategies:
- Contingency Plans:
```

## Anti-patterns

- Skipping the planning phase
- Inadequate task breakdown
- Missing dependency analysis
- Poor sync/async classification
- Insufficient quality gates
- Ignored risks

## Implementation Steps

1. **Initial Assessment**
   - Review mission brief
   - Gather requirements
   - Identify stakeholders
   - Assess complexity

2. **Plan Development**
   - Generate initial plan
   - Review with team
   - Refine based on feedback
   - Finalize approach

3. **Execution Setup**
   - Assign resources
   - Set up tracking
   - Establish checkpoints
   - Begin implementation
