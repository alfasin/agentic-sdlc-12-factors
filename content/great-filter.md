# VI. The Great Filter: Human as Ultimate Quality Arbiter

## Statement

The human developer is "The Great Filter," applying irreplaceable judgment to all AI-generated output before it enters the codebase.

## Explanation

The Great Filter factor establishes that while AI can generate code quickly, the human developer's judgment is irreplaceable. The developer must act as the final quality gate, applying deep domain knowledge, architectural vision, and professional experience to ensure all AI-generated code meets production standards.
